Project rules (English only):
- Documentation, comments, and inline notes must be in English.
- Favor clarity and simplicity: follow KISS, DRY, YAGNI; avoid premature optimization.
- Align structure with FSD (Feature-Sliced Design); place code by feature slice with shared layers clearly separated.
- Prefer explicitness over magic; name things descriptively.
- Keep tests/docs updated alongside code changes.
